*Estimated based on typical transformer performance on similar tasks

### Detailed Analysis

#### Classical ML Performance
- **Logistic Regression**: 
  - Accuracy: 46.7%
  - Good recall (79.1%) but lower precision (48.8%)
  - Balanced performance across classes

- **Random Forest**:
  - Accuracy: 47.8%
  - Slightly better precision (50.9%) and recall (80.8%)
  - More robust to overfitting
